# Handwritten_Digit_Classifier
This is a computer vision project that builds an artificial neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.

No deep learning libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch) are used here. However, NumPy is used to make the efficiency faster with its vectorized functions.
